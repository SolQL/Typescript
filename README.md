Aims to have .solql extension files, which enable querying onchain data with arbitrary solidity code.



## Commenting pattern
Comments preceed the function/component they describe.
Consider the following example:


/*
    this function does cool things
*/
function doCoolThings() {
    return "ALT + F4";
}
