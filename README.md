Aims to have .solql extension files, which enable querying onchain data with arbitrary solidity code.



## Commenting pattern
Comments precede the function/method/class they describe.
Consider the following example:

```
/*
    this function does cool things
*/

function doCoolThings() {
    return "ALT + F4";
}
```
